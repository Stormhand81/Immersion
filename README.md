Immersion – A Minimal, Intelligent UI for a More Cinematic Warcraft

Immersion is a lightweight quality-of-life addon designed to make the World of Warcraft interface feel cleaner, smarter, and more immersive — without sacrificing essential gameplay information.

Developed with a philosophy of “invisible until needed”, Immersion dynamically hides cluttered UI elements and brings them back only when they matter. The result is a more cinematic experience that respects the original look of WoW while offering a refined and modernized style.

✨ Key Features
• Smart UI Visibility

Immersion automatically hides selected UI elements during normal gameplay — such as action bars, player frame, and other panels — and reveals them instantly on mouse-over, combat, or specific triggers.
You decide when the UI shows itself.

• Dragonflight UI Detection

If the player has Dragonflight UI (DFUI) enabled, Immersion adapts automatically, safely hiding the default player frame and other redundant elements. No setup required.

• Clean PlayerFrame Handling

The addon hides the original PlayerFrame to reduce noise, while still allowing mouseover reactivation when applicable — fully integrated with WoW’s native behavior and DFUI layouts.

• Perfect for Immersion-Focused Players

Explorers, roleplayers, and minimal-UI enthusiasts will appreciate the calmer screen and the sensation of “being inside the world,” instead of staring at a HUD.

🎯 Why Immersion Exists

Most UI-hiding addons behave aggressively or come with heavy frameworks.
Immersion takes a different approach:

Simple codebase

Small footprint

Smooth transitions

Subtle behavior

No unnecessary configuration

It’s a tool designed for players who love WoW’s aesthetics and want to preserve them — while removing the distractions that break the experience.
