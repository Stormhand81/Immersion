# Immersion  
*A Minimal, Intelligent UI for a More Cinematic Warcraft*

**Immersion** is a lightweight quality-of-life addon designed to make the World of Warcraft interface feel cleaner, smarter, and more immersive — without sacrificing essential gameplay information.

Developed with a philosophy of **“invisible until needed”**, Immersion dynamically hides cluttered UI elements and brings them back only when they matter. The result is a more cinematic experience that respects WoW’s original aesthetic while offering a refined and modernized feel.

Made to work with [DragonFlight UI: Reforged](https://github.com/Stormhand81/DragonflightUI-Reforged) or Vanilla UI.

## ✨ Key Features

### Smart UI Visibility
Immersion automatically hides selected UI elements during normal gameplay — such as action bars, the player frame, and other panels — and reveals them instantly on mouse-over, combat, or specific triggers.

You decide when the UI shows itself.

---

### Dragonflight UI Detection
If **DragonFlight UI: Reforged** is enabled, Immersion adapts automatically, safely hiding the default player frame and other redundant elements.

No setup required.

---

### Clean PlayerFrame Handling
The addon hides the original PlayerFrame to reduce visual noise, while still allowing mouse-over reactivation when applicable.

Fully integrated with WoW’s native behavior and DragonFlight UI layouts.

---

### Perfect for Immersion-Focused Players
Explorers, roleplayers, and minimal-UI enthusiasts will appreciate the calmer screen and the sensation of *being inside the world*, rather than staring at a HUD.

---

## 🎯 Why Immersion Exists

Most UI-hiding addons behave aggressively or rely on heavy frameworks.

**Immersion takes a different approach:**

- Simple codebase  
- Small footprint  
- Smooth transitions  
- Subtle, intelligent behavior  
- No unnecessary configuration  

It is a tool for players who love WoW’s aesthetics and want to preserve them — while removing the distractions that break immersion.
